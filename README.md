# 📚 LeetCode Solutions Repository

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! I'm **Mohamed Dawood**, a passionate coder tackling algorithmic challenges. This repository contains my solutions to **150 LeetCode problems**, all written in **C++**, stored as individual `.cpp` files named after each problem for quick revision and to showcase my problem-solving skills.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- 🗂️ Store solutions to 150 LeetCode problems as standalone C++ files in the root directory.
- 📝 Provide well-commented code with explanations for easy understanding.
- 🚀 Demonstrate my proficiency in C++ and algorithmic thinking to potential employers or collaborators.
- 🔄 Serve as a personal resource for revisiting algorithms and data structures.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each of the 150 solutions is saved as a single C++ file in the repository root, named after the corresponding LeetCode problem (e.g., `two_sum.cpp`, `add_two_numbers.cpp`). Each file includes:

- 📄 **Problem Description**: A brief overview in comments with a link to the original LeetCode problem.
- 💻 **Code**: C++ implementation with detailed comments explaining the logic.
- 📊 **Explanation**: Approach details and time/space complexity (within code comments).

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **🔍 Browse Solutions**: Locate the `.cpp` file by problem name to view the solution and comments.
2. **🔎 Search**: Use GitHub's search bar to find problems by name or number.
3. **🤝 Contribute**: Have suggestions or improvements? Open an issue or submit a pull request!

## 📝 Notes

- 🌱 This repository is actively maintained and will include all 150 C++ solutions as I progress.
- ✍️ Each `.cpp` file is named after its LeetCode problem for easy identification and contains detailed comments for clarity.
- 💡 Feel free to explore, but I recommend solving problems independently first to maximize learning.

**Happy Coding!** 🚀
